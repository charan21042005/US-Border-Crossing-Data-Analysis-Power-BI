#  US Border Crossing Data Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

An end-to-end Power BI analytics project analyzing U.S. border crossing activity to uncover traffic patterns, port performance, transport mode contributions, seasonal trends, and future outlook using forecasting.

This project demonstrates **data modeling, DAX proficiency, and analytical storytelling** using a real-world U.S. government dataset.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of U.S. border crossings across:

- Ports of entry
- U.S.–Mexico and U.S.–Canada borders
- Multiple transport modes
- Time dimensions (monthly, yearly, seasonal)
- Forecasting and future trends

The goal is to support **operational planning, infrastructure optimization, and data-driven decision-making** for cross-border operations.

## 📊 Key Analytical Highlights

- U.S.–Mexico border accounts for the majority of total crossings.
- A small number of ports contribute a disproportionately large share of traffic (Pareto effect).
- Personal vehicles dominate overall border traffic.
- Clear seasonal patterns with peak activity during mid-year months.
- Significant decline around 2020 followed by gradual recovery.
- Forecast indicates continued recovery with moderate volatility.
