# 🇺🇸 US Border Crossing Data Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

An end-to-end **Power BI analytics project** analyzing U.S. border crossing activity to uncover traffic patterns, port performance, transport mode contributions, seasonal trends, and future outlook using forecasting.

This project demonstrates **data modeling, DAX proficiency, and analytical storytelling** using a real-world government dataset.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of U.S. border crossings across:

- Ports of entry  
- U.S.–Mexico and U.S.–Canada borders  
- Multiple transport modes  
- Time (monthly, yearly, seasonal)  

It is designed to support **operational planning, infrastructure optimization, and data-driven decision-making**.

---

## 📊 Key Analytical Highlights

- Executive overview of total crossings, ports, and YoY growth
- Port-level performance and traffic concentration (Pareto Analysis)
- Border-wise comparison of traffic volume and operational load
- Transport mode contribution analysis
- Temporal and seasonal trend analysis
- Rolling averages and volatility assessment
- Forecasting and future outlook using time-series analytics
- Operational insights and strategic recommendations

## 🎯 Key Insights

- The **U.S.–Mexico border** handles the majority of total crossings.
- A small number of ports account for a disproportionately large share of traffic (Pareto effect).
- **Personal vehicles** dominate overall traffic volume.
- Clear **seasonal patterns** with peak activity during mid-year months.
- A sharp decline around **2020** reflects external disruptions, followed by gradual recovery.
- Forecasting indicates a **continued upward recovery trend** with moderate volatility.

---

## 📈 Strategic Recommendations

- Prioritize infrastructure and staffing at high-volume ports.
- Implement seasonal resource planning to handle predictable surges.
- Monitor high-volatility ports for operational risk mitigation.
- Use forecast insights for short-term capacity and policy planning.
